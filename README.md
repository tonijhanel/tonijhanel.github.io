## Work Experience
**Principal Solution Consultant @ Adobe (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Lead and analyze discovery sessions with users and client stakeholders to understand their use cases, system requirements, and pain points. Present key findings to users, executive stakeholders, and Adobe's product team, ensuring solutions address core user needs and business objectives.
- Collaborate with the product team to prioritize development of new features and enhancements based on continuous customer feedback, ongoing discovery sessions, and customer interviews. This ensures product development aligns with market demands and user expectations.
- Develop and present multi-solution architecture implementation plans to users and stakeholders. These plans leverage Adobe Experience Cloud solutions like AEM (Sites, Assets & Forms), Adobe Target, and Adobe Analytics, creating customized and integrated solutions that address specific client challenges.
- Create and present custom demos and integrations for the Adobe Experience Manager platform using Java and full-stack development skills (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This allows stakeholders to visualize the potential of proposed solutions.
- Effectively present demos and product architecture to both developers and stakeholders, tailoring communication style to each audience.
- Build headless applications using jQuery, enabling seamless integration of content management systems (CMS) with front-end applications.


**Technical Architect @ Adobe (_May 2016 - December 2020_)**
- Led the design, integration, and requirements research for Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, ensuring optimal user experience and technical feasibility.
- Managed large-scale projects with multiple developers, utilizing user research findings to inform architecture and integration decisions. As a development lead, I effectively planned and coordinated resources, ensuring project success
- Created and delivered architecture and integration diagrams, development documents, and solution design plans based on user research insights. In my role as development lead, I ensured these deliverables were clear and actionable for the team.
- Successfully delivered a 1 million-dollar AEM Forms conversion project through a combined approach requirements gathering, technical leadership, and developer team management. My leadership ensured efficient resource allocation and clear communication, leading to project success
- Led a team of developers as a Development Lead, providing technical guidance, mentoring, and ensuring project milestones were met.

**Independent Senior Full-Stack Developer (2000 -2016)

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
